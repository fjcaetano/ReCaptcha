-----

Add Google's [Invisible ReCaptcha v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible) to your project. This library
automatically handles ReCaptcha's events and retrieves the validation token or notifies you to present the challenge if
invisibility is not possible.

#### _Warning_ ⚠️

Beware that this library only works for ReCaptcha v2 Invisible keys! Make sure to check the reCAPTCHA
v2 Invisible badge option when creating your [API Key](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create).

You won't be able to use a ReCaptcha v3 key because it requires server-side validation. On v3, all
challenges succeed into a token which is then validated in the server for a score. For this reason,
a frontend app can't know on its own wether or not a user is valid since the challenge will always
result in a valid token.

## Installation

ReCaptcha is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) and [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
To install it, simply add the following line to your dependencies file:

#### Cocoapods
``` ruby
pod "ReCaptcha"
# or
pod "ReCaptcha/RxSwift"
```

#### Carthage
``` ruby
github "fjcaetano/ReCaptcha"
```

Carthage will create two different frameworks named `ReCaptcha` and `ReCaptcha_RxSwift`, the latter containing the RxSwift
extension for the ReCaptcha framework.

## Usage

The reCAPTCHA keys can be specified as Info.plist keys or can be passed as parameters when instantiating ReCaptcha().

For the Info.plist configuration, add `ReCaptchaKey` and `ReCaptchaDomain` (with a protocol ex. http:// or https://) to your Info.plist and run:

``` swift
let recaptcha = try? ReCaptcha()

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    recaptcha?.configureWebView { [weak self] webview in
        webview.frame = self?.view.bounds ?? CGRect.zero
    }
}


func validate() {
    recaptcha?.validate(on: view) { [weak self] (result: ReCaptchaResult) in
        print(try? result.dematerialize())
    }
}
```

If instead you prefer to keep the information out of the Info.plist, you can use:
``` swift
let recaptcha = try? ReCaptcha(
    apiKey: "YOUR_RECAPTCHA_KEY", 
    baseURL: URL(string: "YOUR_RECAPTCHA_DOMAIN")!
)

...
```

You can also install the reactive subpod and use it with RxSwift:

``` swift
recaptcha.rx.validate(on: view)
    .subscribe(onNext: { (token: String) in
        // Do something
    })
```

#### Alternte endpoint

If your app has firewall limitations that may be blocking Google's API, the JS endpoint may be changed on initialization.
It'll then point to `https://www.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api.js`:

``` swift
public enum Endpoint {
    case default, alternate
}

let recaptcha = try? ReCaptcha(endpoint: .alternate) // Defaults to `default` when unset
```
